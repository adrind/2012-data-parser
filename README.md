I made a simple Node app to parse the violations data. As a web developer, I am the most comfortable with Javascript so even though this seems like overkill it was actually very straightforward :)


Project template was generated by express-generator package, I simply modified the index route to contain the logic to parse the csv folder and then rendered it with Bootstrap and Jade. Then it was just a matter of hosting it for free on Heroku!
